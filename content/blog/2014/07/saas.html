Companies struggle with the questions:

* When do I need which type of service? 
* Which are the criteria used to decide which model I need? 

This is where coolDEVOPS can help and assist you.

####Saas

[Is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) Most small companies use [Google apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/)  for email, calendaring and contacts. In some cases also for the google docs. Others can include [Evernote](http://evernote.com) for business, [Dropbox](htp://dropbox.com) for business and many others.

For development you also have a lot of SaaS solutions like New Relic for application logging or [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com) for log aggregations and many others.

When you start your company the total cost of ownership is low. But when you start growing this cost increases. The more users the higher the cost of the service or for some development resources the cost increases by usage. Also there is a cost in user management for all these applications. As for Google apps you need to delete users, add users and a lot of other actions.

When your company starts growing and it's it gets difficult to manage all these tools we can help you. We setup process to keep it easy, simple and clear. We also can advice you for which tool a SaaS model is the best and for which model it's bets to setup your own hosted solution. Our hourly cost to keep the system running can be cheaper than having a google apps for 20 users! 

####Paas 

[Is a category of cloud computing services that provides a computing platform and a solution stack as a service.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is one of the most famous examples for this. You're a git commit away to deploy on heroku. A developer can do this without any hassle. This is a good solution to have a quick deploy. But when you get traction it's sensible to have a n-tier solution with fail over and backup. When you get traction and you want to make sure your uptime is at greatest contact us. 

####Iaas 

[To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29)

* Rent your own hardware? 
* Use VPS providers? 
* How and when do we scale?
* Assist in setup automated deploys.
* How do we backup everything?
* How do we setup redundancy?

Keep an eye on this blog where we continue to investigate these type of questions.
