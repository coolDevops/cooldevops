Companies struggle with when do I need which type of service. Which criteria are used to decide which model I need? This is where coolDEVOPS can help and assist you.

#Saas

Is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. In most small companies Google apps is used for email, calendaring and contacts. In some cases also for the google docs. Others can include Evernote for business, Dropbox for business and many others.

For development you also have a lot of SaaS solutions like New Relic for application logging or Loggly for log aggregations and many others.

When you start your company the total cost of ownership is low. But when you start growing this cost increases. The more users the higher the cost of the service or for some development resources the cost increases by usage. Also there is a cost in user management for all these applications. As for Google apps you need to delete users, add users.

When your company starts growing and it's it gets difficult to manage all these tools we can help you. We setup process to keep it easy, simple and clear. We also can advice you for which tool a SaaS model is the best and for which model it's bets to setup your own hosted solution. Our hourly cost to keep the system running can be cheaper than having a google apps for 20 users! A

#Paas 

Is a category of cloud computing services that provides a computing platform and a solution stack as a service. 

Actually this is what is meant by self-service operations.

You have 2 different kinds of Paas solutions.

## Shared Cloud solution

Heroku is one of the most famous examples for this. Just do a git commit to heroku and you're deployed. A developer can do this at a bootstrapped startup. Easy and no hassles. But when your company get's tractions the cost can increase dramatically! As long as you're bootstrapped you won't need our services. PaaS solution is just fine in your case.

## Private Cloud solution

This is something that could benefit large enterprises. You have more control of this environment if you have to fulfill regulatory requirements. You can integrate better with your legacy systems like customized COTS and own legacy developments. At coolDEVOPS we can provide expert consultancy if you are in need of a private cloud solution like OpenStack.

#Iaas 

To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed.

This model is something we use a lot at coolDEVOPS. Companies have a lot of options what types fo services to choose. Rent your own hardware? Use VPS providers? How and when do we scale. Working on deployment. How do we backup everything. How do we setup redundancy, ... A lot of questions where coolDEVOPS can answer. Keep an eye on this blog where we continue to investigate these type of questions.
