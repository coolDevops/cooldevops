## Glenn Plas

Glenn was born into a technical family, being exposed to serious computing early in life as a child he found his true passion rather quickly.  Programming since the age of 12, the hunger to feed the brain even more has taken over since then.  When his path crossed with the unix OS the drive to focus on unix and later linux work surged.  By now he has over +16 years of experience as senior unix and linux system administrator and every odd job as the lead developer roles.  He's highly specialized in:

- Server tuning
- Conceptual R&D
- MariaDB / MysqlDB (especially the Percona / MariaDB community) tuning / setup / configuration
- Programming platforms
- Nginx webserver / fpm
- Haproxy
- Xenserver (XCP-XAPI)
- REST API design and consumer
- programming in several languages

He knows how to keep services and systems running 24/7 and scale where needed and likes to pro-actively identify issues before being problematic.  He knows how to up/down scale systems manually or using automated tools in both cloud and non-clouded environments.   He embraces simply, effective solutions over complicated ones and thinks that by being exposed to very mission critical environments for a long time he's able to offer this knowledge and experience as a package.

Glenn is a person that uses phrases and concepts like 'RFC-Compliancy', 'Perception is reality' etc.  Some of those are considered old-school these days.

In his spare time he likes to spend quality time with his twin daughters and watch the stock market fly and reads books and fix -real- things that are broken.

## Geert Theys

Geert has several years as a developer in different technologies behind the belt.   He's always been interested in the system administration impact while optimizing his code he became aware of the interaction between coder and operator.  
Geert served on various projects primarily in the banking, internet provider and software development world.

On a sunny day at the job, he crossed paths with Glenn --who quickly identified his potential and the fact he got hired by the wrong department-- and not so much later Geert was part of the core system administration team of a large ISP.  This is now 14 years ago.  At the time, this department already embraced what later would be knows as the devops culture.  Where systemadmins learned from coders and vice versa.

He was also a pioneer and early adopter of several processes en techniques before they became real buzzwords:

- Version control rollout in CVS (before 2000) - early git adopter and advocate
- Continuous integration with automatic deployments using CVS tag and custom configuration setups for 3 different staging environments (also before 2000)
- Implementing Scrum in his company mid 2000 using XP principles

Never standing still - always on the move, Geert evolved alonside proven technologies and grew together with new and refreshing idea's around building sofware and services.
