## Geert Theys

Geert has several years as developer in different technologies behind the belt. He's always interested in system administration and knows his way around a linux server.

He was a pioneer in several processes en techniques before there were popular names for it:

- Version control rollout in CVS (before 2000)
- Continuous integration with automatic deployments using CVS tag and custom configuration setups for 3 different staging environments (also before 2000)
- Implementing Scrum in his company mid 2000 using XP principles

Off course this is old stuff and he knows his way around the modern tool belt too.
