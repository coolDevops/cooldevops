### Arcelor Mittal

#### RFID driver authentication

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">

We rolled out this project for SynTrace.

Goal of this project was to have a mobile RFID / GPRS communication solution for Arcelor Mittal driver license management in cooperation with Synctrace.com as a solution supplier. A digital replacement of a starters key on industrial transport vehicles.

The Arcelor Mittal RFID system is unique in the sense that each system needs to work under extreme conditions where no GPS/GPRS signal can exist.  It has to store the driver license database in every tracking unit and acts as a digital engine key.   This is one our trademark projects.  Not only is this a highly demanding environment,  there is little room for error.

##### Our role in this project:

- Designed and architected a solution with the technical difficulties special to Arcelor Mittal
- We were the liaison between all the different suppliers to coordinate the solution for Arcelor Mital
- Integrated all the software with our solution.

We not only think out of the box but for us there is no box. We try to think ahead to mitigate any technical difficulties in advance without increasing your budget to foresee issues that will never exist.

In this project several issues were mitigated right from the start:

- Electrical failure
- Storage planning or resource planning in general.
- High availability.
- Tuning
