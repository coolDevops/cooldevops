# Projecten

We not only work on projects defined by companies. But we also help to define strategic projects to make sure the their business keeps running and scales for the future. 

In light of these strategic projects we also offer day to day operational assitance to their existing devops/sysadmin teams.

### ArcelorMittal 

#### RFID driver authentication

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">

Goal of this project was to have a mobile RFID / GPRS communication solution for ArcelorMittal driver license management in co-operporation with Synctrace.com as a solution supplier. A digital replacement of a starters key on industrial transport vehicles.

The Arcelormittal RFID system is unique in the sense that each system needs to work under extreme conditions where no GPS/GPRS signal can exist.  It has to store the driver license database in every tracking unit and acts as a digital engine key.   This is one our trademark projects.  Not only is this a highly demanding environment,  there is little room for error.

##### Our role in this project:

- Designed and architected a solution with the technical difficulties special to Arcelor mitral
- We were the liason between all the different suppliers to coordinate the solution for Arcelor Mital
- Integrated all the software with our solution.

We not not only think out of the box but for us there is no box. We try to think ahead to mitigate any technical difficulties in advance without increasing your budget to forsee issues that will never exist.

In this project several issues were mitigated right from the start:

- Electrical failure
- storage planning or resource planning in general.  
- High availability.   
- Tuning.
