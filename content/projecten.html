## ArcelorMittal

On the Arcelor mittal project we acted as a technical lead and core architect, designer, and implementation force.  We still provide them continued supporting services.  We architected and developed the mobile RFID / GPRS communication system for ArcelorMittal in coorporation with Synctrace.com as a solution supplier.   The AM-RFID system has been in place since mid 2012.  Due to the nature of the game, lives depend on the working of this system.  Together with hardware suppliers and inhouse software development we created a system that is able to service 24/7.   The Arcelormittal RFID system is unique in the sense that each system needs to work under extreme conditions where no GPS/GPRS signal can exist.  It has to store the driver license database in every tracking unit and acts as a digital engine key.   This is one our trademark projects.  Not only is this a highly demanding environment,  there is little room for error.
But the reason this is our trademark is because we are experienced in thinking about every possible scenario.  We think ahead and compensate for future issues by getting (a lot) right from the start.  From electrical failure to storage planning or resource planning in general.  High availability.   Tuning.  And glueing things with our custom software.

Not only do we work on the technical implementation.  We also bring ArcelorMittal to the map,  we completed Openstreetmaps data with a detailed micromap of entrances/exists.  For an organisation like AM knowing the closest door number to a certain device turned out to be crucial.  We love bringing creative solutions to the table.
